    "Introduction to machine learning\n",
    "What is machine learninfg?\n",
    "- Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions, relying instead on patterns and inference from data.\n",
    "- It involves training models on large datasets to make predictions or decisions based on new data.\n",
    "- Subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and also experience without explicit programming them.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved Decision Making: Machine learning algorithms can analyze large volumes of data quickly and accurately, providing insights that help organizations make informed decisions.\n",
    "2. Automation of Repetitive Tasks: ML can automate routine tasks, freeing up human resources for more complex and creative work.\n",
    "3. Enhanced Customer Experiences: By analyzing customer data, ML can help businesses personalize their offerings and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
    "4. Predictive Analytics: Machine learning can identify trends and patterns in data, enabling organizations to anticipate future outcomes and make proactive decisions.\n",
    "5. Cost Savings: By optimizing processes and improving efficiency, machine learning can lead to significant cost reductions for businesses.\n",
    "6. Continuous Improvement: ML models can learn and adapt over time, improving their accuracy and effectiveness as they are exposed to more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "1. Supervised Learning : In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The model learns to map inputs to the correct output and can make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Types\n",
    "    - Linear regression\n",
    "    - Logistuc regression\n",
    "    - Decision trees\n",
    "    - Support vector machines(SVM)\n",
    "    - K-nearest neighbours\n",
    "    - Random Forest\n",
    "    - Deep learning (CNN) : image classification\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unsupervised Learning : Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data without labeled responses. The model tries to learn the underlying structure or distribution in the data to identify patterns or groupings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Types\n",
    "    - K-means clustering\n",
    "    - Hierarchical clustering\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Reinforcement Learning : Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. The agent learns from the consequences of its actions rather than from explicit examples.\n",
    "4. Semi-supervised Learning : Semi-supervised learning is a hybrid approach that combines labeled and unlabeled data for training. It is useful when acquiring a fully labeled dataset is expensive or time-consuming.\n",
